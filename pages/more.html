            <p class="descriptionItem">
              The idea is a scavenger hunt game around the city of Reykjavík. The checkpoints in the hunt are in the form of QR-codes. The game uses information about places and events that have been gathered in a database. The idea is having QR-codes distributed at points of interest around the city centre. You can begin the game wherever you are in the city. Jump in anywhere, anytime! 
              The users can select criterias based on their interests. The game finds the best route based on the chosen preferences, the time you have to discover the city and the distance you’re willing to go. If you don’t know what you want to see or are feeling adventurous then you can also get a wildcard, where you choose your preferred distance and a random route is generated based on that. 
              To make it easier for event planners to submit their event there will be a website hosted by the City of Reykjavík where certified event-planners/venues can submit in a simple way. A simple information form is filled out (from a drop-down list). The information entered then becomes a part of a big database that the City of Reykjavik owns, and can be utilized for other means as well, such as making search engines out of it.
